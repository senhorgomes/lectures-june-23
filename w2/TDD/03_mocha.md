# Mocha and Chai

Mocha is a testing framework, and chai is the assertion library.

Actual vs expected

We can use Mocha for shallow testing, but Chai helps us dig into deeper values with a better assertion library
# How to install?

As simple as
`npm install --save-dev mocha@"9.2.2" chai@"4.3.1" --save-dev`
