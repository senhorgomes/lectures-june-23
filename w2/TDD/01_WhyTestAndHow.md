# Why should we test our code?

In the event that our function is going into a bigger application, we should test it fully.

Make sure it doesn't break.

Our function is as solid as possible.

# How do we test our code?

We do so using asssert statements.

## Paths/Edge Cases

Happy paths

What are ways that the app/function won't break

Non-happy paths

What are ways that our app/function can break

TDD -> Test driven development

1. Pick a path/edge case

2. Create a test for our function to fail

3. Build/refactor our function to pass the test

4. Repeat
